‘Click’

My project is a minimalist artwork composed of white lines on a black canvas. 
Users are encouraged, via the title of the piece, to ‘click’ their way through 5 different mouse and mic-reactive patches.

My work is not a direct reaction to Bridle’s essay. 
I unintentionally avoided engaging with the essay, as I started working on the prompt making formalist art...which eventually took precedence over connections to the text.

I had (surprisingly) strong feelings about Bridle’s text, despite this project’s outcome. 
Something is definitely wrong online: we do live in a dystopian state of monetized content production, that especially victimizes youth. There is a machine at play that will continue to generate views/$ at the expense of a safe online space.

The reason I didn’t produce a work addressing Bridle’s text has nothing to do with my strong negative feelings about the subject, and everything to do with where I’m @ code-wise and what inspired me over the last 2 weeks...I really just wanted to play around with graphics. 
I incorporated speech recognition to my piece for the word “click”, so that I meet the bare requirements for this assignment, but tbh annyang would not have otherwise been included in this codebase.
